# Xcode Swift Code Snippets and Themes

I want to present you some convenient code snippets I gathered for working. 

## How to import all code snippets to Xcode
All Xcode code snippets exist as a `.plist` files in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/`
You can simply copy all code snippets (`.codesnippet`) into this folder, restart Xcode and you should have all of them ready to use.

Note: Create the folder if it doesn't exist already. It is created by Xcode when user adds his first custom snippet.

## How to import all the themes to XCode
All Xcode Themes exist as a `.plist` files in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/` You can simple copy all themes (`.dvtcolortheme`) into this folder, restart XCode and you should have all of them ready to use. Now you can go to Xcode -> Preferences -> Fonts & Colors and select your theme.

## Snippets
The snippets starting with the pattern `swift-...` so you can just type in the XCode and they will show up for you for auto-completion.

```
swift-tableViewDataSource.codesnippet
swift-tableViewDelegate.codesnippet

```
